# SoftwareSecurity

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

The client was Artemis Financial and they are a consulting company that develops financial plans for their customers including savings, retirement, investment and insurance. They needed to improve their software by incorporating effective software security strategies in order to protect user data and financial information. In my second project, Artemis Financial needed to add a file verification step (checksum) to its web application to enable secure communication.


What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?



What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Three resources that were useful for me during this class that I will continue to use are the Spring Framework website, the OWASP website and the Java Platform SE 8 website. The Spring Framework website helped me understand more about Spring Boot. I would like to continue learning more about Boot and other features. The OWASP website helped me learn more about the Dependency Check tool. I would like to learn more about other tools that are offered that could be useful in future projects. The Java Platform SE 8 website was useful in learning about different algorithm ciphers. This website will be useful in continuing to learn Java specific libraries or features. I plan to continue to refer to these resources in order to deepen my understanding of software security and improve my practices as a developer. 
 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
